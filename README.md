# Some Basic Stock Analysis in R
The data used was downloaded from Yahoo! Finance on the 17th of March and contains 252 rows of market data.
I calculated periodic returns, added these to the data frames as a new column and then used ggplot for a simply line graph.
With gridExtra, I was able to plot the four stocks side-by-side for an easier way to compare them visually.
Afterwards, I used a very simple method to compute portfolio weights and plotted these as a bar plot. The file also contains various commented code sections which I deem useful for study, yet irrelevant for use in an actual application.

My future work will build op on this project and I hope to soon be able to use other methods for portfolio optimization, pricing, etc!
